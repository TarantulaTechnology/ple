      <p class="summary">This text covers all the usual programming language
      concepts, including binding, scope, typing, parameterization, modularity, concurrency,
      and meta&shy;programming, not through a dry explanation of each topic, but rather
      within the context of whole-language overviews with plenty of runnable
      example scripts. We aim to help developers learn a bit of theory, and
      introduce students to a number of modern languages. All of the source
      code for the book&rsquo;s examples, as well as number of bonus scripts,
      are found in <a href="https://github.com/rtoal/ple">a GitHub
      repository</a>.</p>


      <div class="sectionheading">Contents</div>

      <dl>
        <dt>Chapter 0 Introduction
        <dd>A little on why the study of languages is fun and some hints about
        what&rsquo;s coming up in the rest of the book.

        <dt>Chapter 1 JavaScript
        <dd>A tour of one of the world&rsquo;s most popular languages, introducing
        assignment, references, shallow and deep copies, null and undefined, weak
        typing, assertions, anonymous and higher-order functions, stack frames,
        closures, static vs. dynamic scope, shallow vs. deep binding,
        methods, prototypes, and asynchronous programming with both
        callbacks and promises.

        <dt>Chapter 2 CoffeeScript
        <dd>A tour of a language that compiles to JavaScript, or as is sometimes
        said, <strong>is</strong> JavaScript&mdash;though with an alternate syntax
        (you&rsquo;ll notice a <em>lot</em> less clutter). We take a first
        look at destructuring and existential operators, and explore a very
        interesting design decision that avoids shadowing almost everywhere.

        <dt>Chapter 3 Lua
        <dd>A tour of the well-loved lightweight scripting language behind
        World of Warcraft and Angry Birds (among others), introducing
        some new types, an approach to errors that avoids exceptions,
        and a unification of arrays and dictionaries known as the table.
        We also see metatables, which provide both differential inheritance
        and operator overloading, and see coroutines for the first time.

        <dt>Chapter 4 Python
        <dd>Our first language with a sophisticated type system, where types
        are objects within the language, and the programmer can
        define new types. This chapter introduces supertype-subtype
        relationships, multiple inheritance, keyword arguments,
        pass-by-sharing, special methods, iterators and generators,
        and decorators.

        <dt>Chapter 5 Ruby
        <dd>Object-orientation and much more within an overview of the language
        billed as &ldquo;A programmer&rsquo;s best friend.&rdquo; We define
        messaging, encapsulation, (class-based) inheritance, and polymorphism, and look
        at access controls and singleton classes. Ruby&rsquo;s blocks and
        mixins bring up some new issues, as does the language&rsquo;s extensive
        metaprogramming capabilities.

        <dt>Chapter 6 Julia
        <dd>A tour of the new dynamic language for scientific computing where
        we encounter abstract types, parametric types, sum and product types,
        and the notions of covariance, contravariance, and invariance. We see
        polymorphism with multiple dispatch (differing from the single-receiver
        forms of previous languages), a metaprogramming facility with
        hygienic macros, and language support for parallel and distributed
        computing.

        <dt>Chapter 7 Java
        <dd>An exploration of our first statically-typed language with coverage
        of classes, modifiers, interfaces, generics, optionals (and their
        relationship to the billion dollar mistake), reflection,
        and quite a lot about threads and synchronization.

        <dt>Chapter 8 Clojure
        <dd>A tour of the mostly-functional, modern dialect of Lisp, that
        inter&shy;operates with Java. We look at its interesting syntax, its rich set of data
        types, and its implementation of namespaces; then introduce persistent
        data structures, transients, software transactional memory, and agents.
        We look at two approaches to the expression problem (protocols and
        multimethods) and discuss how Clojure&rsquo;s hygienic macros compare
        to Julia&rsquo;s.

        <dt>Chapter 9 Elm
        <dd>An overview of the member of the ML-family of languages that
        makes it fun to write reactive web clients in a functional style.
        Our tour introduces the beautiful aspects of the ML-family&mdash;Hindley-Milner
        typing with type variables and extensive type inference, pattern-matching,
        and tagged union types&mdash;as well as Elm&rsquo;s contributions, including
        record types and subscriptions. This chapter (together with
        the overviews of Haskell and Idris in Chapter 14) discusses the general problem
        of managing side-effects in pure functional programming.

        <dt>Chapter 10 Erlang
        <dd>The language known for scalability and incredible seven-nines
        availablity that powers the messaging infrastructure behind Whisper and
        WhatsApp. As Erlang is a functional language like Clojure and Elm (though
        with a rather unique syntax), this chapter continues our discussion on
        loop-free, matching-oriented programming with immutable data. But what
        makes Erlang Erlang is its messaging system based on processes
        without shared memory, and its acheivement of high availability
        through a philosophy known, perhaps surprisingly, as &ldquo;Let it
        Crash.&rdquo;

        <dt>Chapter 11 Go
        <dd>Another language emphasizing distributed programming via message
        passing, but unlike Erlang, places the focus on channels rather than
        named processes. Our tour introduces a few other concepts, too,
        such as multiple-value function returns, defer statements, explicit pointers,
        slices, and panics. We examine Go&rsquo;s level of type inference, which
        falls somewhere in between Java&rsquo;s and Elm&rsquo;s.

        <dt>Chapter 12 Swift
        <dd>A look at the elegantly-designed, safe, fun, and powerful
        modern language most often used for writing native applications in macOS,
        iOS, tvOS, and watchOS. Here we see character processing done right,
        common collections implemented as library types rather than hardwired
        into the language (though with syntactic sugar to trick you), more on
        optionals, custom operator definitions, extensions, and protocols.
        We also spend time on the details of automatic reference counting (ARC).

        <dt>Chapter 13 Additional Languages
        <dd>Brief looks at Fortran, COBOL, Lisp, Algol, Simula, Smalltalk, C,
        C++, Rust, CLU, Ada, C#, Scala, Bash, Perl, Standard ML, OCaml, Haskell,
        F#, Idris, ParaSail, Chapel, Elixir, PHP, Hack, TypeScript, Dart, APL,
        Prolog, K, Io, Factor, Brainfuck, Befunge, LOLCODE, and nasm (an assembly
        language for the x86 architecture). This chapter is by no means and
        afterthought or an aside; the sections on Rust and C, in particular,
        have a bit to say about dealing with explicit pointers without
        a garbage collector, while other sections introduce new programming
        paradigms not covered in the twelve featured language chapters.

        <dt>Chapter 14 Afterword
        <dd>A review of language concepts in a Socratic fashion.

        <dt>Appendix A Numbers
        <dd>Encodings of fixed-size integers and IEEE-754 floating point numbers.

        <dt>Appendix B Text
        <dd>All you need to know about Unicode (including what extended
        grapheme clusters are, and how exactly UTF-8 works), and a
        little bit more.
      </dl>


      <div class="sectionheading">Good to Know</div>

      <p>Some prerequisites: This book is not for beginning programmers. We
      assume you know at least two languages pretty well, and hopefully a couple
      more. You should know the basic concepts surrounding variables, expressions,
      operators, functions, and basic data structures, and have experience
      writing nontrivial applications&mdash;this book is a <em>tour</em>, not a
      <em>tutorial</em>. We cover many interesting (and often powerful) features,
      and <strong>purposely do so with code that is often very dense and sometimes
      cryptic, even when presenting unfamiliar paradigms for the first
      time</strong>. If you like to learn by reading example code, and
      performing your own experiments, you should
      find the approach to your liking.</p>

      <p>Most of the code examples are written as their own unit tests,
      which should help you learn the concepts as you read the code itself.
      We favor this style over excessive commenting.
      <a href="http://www.kyleblaney.com/software-blog/2012/6/29/comments-are-a-failure.html">Uncle
      Bob tells us why comments are not &ldquo;pure good.&rdquo;</a></p>

      <p>Please note the book is <em>not</em> a treatise based on formal
      syntax and semantics. For deeper theory, see, for example,
      <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/computer-science/programming-languages-and-applied-logic/practical-foundations-programming-languages-2nd-edition">Harper</a>,

      <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/design-concepts-programming-languages">Turbak and Gifford</a>.
      Looking for more on history? Start with Wikipedia&rsquo;s articles on programming language
      history and follow links. Make sure to go way back and read some early papers;
      the classics by
      <a href="http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/www.bitsavers.org/pdf/stanford/cs_techReports/STAN-CS-76-562_EarlyDevelPgmgLang_Aug76.pdf">Knuth</a>
      and <a href="http://worrydream.com/EarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk/">Kay</a> are must
      reads for anyone that appreciates and values where the field has come from.

      <div class="sectionheading">Additional Exercises</div>

      <p>The text features 300 exercises, most of which are &ldquo;further
      explorations&rdquo; in which you find or install compilers or interpreters,
      investigate aspects of a language not covered in the chapter proper,
      muse about language designers&rsquo; intents, and try your hand at
      both large and small programming tasks. We&rsquo;ll provide
      a page with a few more. (It&rsquo;s not yet begun, however.) If you
      would like to contribute additional exercises, submit a pull request.
